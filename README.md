# Genseek

**Genseek** 
• Original Idea. A genAI experimental service which makes SQL queries redundant

• Takes natural language from User and fetches data using GenAI..

• Used LangChain to connect to MySQL DB. Query answered by LlaMa-2 (then Meta’s best free model)

• Used FewShot Learning with ChromaDB to enable better context answer

. Every major feature has been implemented, and the project reached its final stages

## Current Status

While the codebase is complete, the project may not currently run due to **outdated credentials** used during development. You'll need to update these credentials in the configuration files to get it up and running again.
